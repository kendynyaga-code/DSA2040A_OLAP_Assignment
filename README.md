# Data Warehouse Implementation: ROLAP, MOLAP, and HOLAP Analysis

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a data warehouse using three different OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) approaches:
- **ROLAP** (Relational OLAP)
- **MOLAP** (Multidimensional OLAP) 
- **HOLAP** (Hybrid OLAP)

The implementation analyzes employee salary data across different departments using SQL aggregation, pivot tables, and hybrid techniques.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Schema
The project uses two main tables:

#### Employees Table
- **name**: Employee name
- **dept_name**: Department name
- **salary**: Employee salary
- **age**: Employee age

#### Departments Table
- **dept_name**: Department name
- **location**: Department location

### 2. Sample Data
The dataset includes employees from three departments:
- **Engineering**: 2 employees (Bob, David)
- **HR**: 3 employees (Alice, Charlie, Frank)
- **Sales**: 1 employee (Eve)

## OLAP Implementations

### 1. ROLAP (Relational OLAP)
**Implementation**: SQL aggregation using pandas operations

**Analysis**: Average salary by department
```python
rolap_result = df.groupby('dept_name')['salary'].mean().reset_index()
```

**Results**:
| Department  | Average Salary |
|-------------|----------------|
| Engineering | $77,500.00     |
| HR          | $93,333.33     |
| Sales       | $60,000.00     |

**Visualization**: Bar chart showing average salaries across departments

### 2. MOLAP (Multidimensional OLAP)
**Implementation**: Pivot table creating a data cube

**Analysis**: Department vs Age salary analysis
```python
molap_cube = pd.pivot_table(df, values='salary', index='dept_name', 
                           columns='age', aggfunc='mean', fill_value=0)
```

**Cube Structure**:
- **Dimensions**: Department, Age
- **Measure**: Salary
- **Cells**: Average salary for each department-age combination

**Results**:
| Department  | 28     | 30     | 32     | 35     | 40     | 45     |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Engineering | 0      | 0      | 75,000 | 80,000 | 0      | 0      |
| HR          | 0      | 70,000 | 0      | 0      | 120,000| 90,000 |
| Sales       | 60,000 | 0      | 0      | 0      | 0      | 0      |

**Visualization**: Heatmap showing salary distribution across departments and ages

### 3. HOLAP (Hybrid OLAP)
**Implementation**: Combines relational and multidimensional approaches

**Analysis**: Summary of average salary by department using both techniques
```python
holap_summary = df.groupby('dept_name')['salary'].mean().reset_index()
```

**Results**: Same as ROLAP but demonstrates hybrid approach capability

## OLAP Operations Demonstrated

### 1. Slice Operation
**Definition**: Extracting a sub-cube by selecting specific dimension values

**Implementation**: Filtering for IT Department
```python
slice_result = df[df['dept_name'] == 'IT']
```

**Result**: Empty DataFrame (no IT department in sample data)

### 2. Dice Operation
**Definition**: Selecting specific values from multiple dimensions

**Implementation**: HR Department with salary > $60,000
```python
dice_result = df[(df['dept_name'] == 'HR') & (df['salary'] > 60000)]
```

**Results**:
- Alice (HR): $70,000
- Charlie (HR): $120,000
- Frank (HR): $90,000

## Key Findings

### Salary Analysis
1. **Highest Average Salary**: HR Department ($93,333.33)
2. **Lowest Average Salary**: Sales Department ($60,000.00)
3. **Engineering Average**: $77,500.00

### Age Distribution
- **Engineering**: Employees aged 32-35
- **HR**: Wide age distribution (30, 40, 45)
- **Sales**: Single employee aged 28

### Department Insights
- **HR** has the highest salary range and most diverse age distribution
- **Engineering** shows moderate salaries with younger workforce
- **Sales** has the smallest team with lowest average salary

## Technical Implementation Details

### Libraries Used
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **numpy**: Numerical operations

### Data Processing Steps
1. **Data Creation**: Sample employee and department data
2. **ROLAP Processing**: SQL-like groupby operations
3. **MOLAP Processing**: Pivot table creation
4. **HOLAP Processing**: Combined approach
5. **OLAP Operations**: Slice and dice implementations
6. **Visualization**: Charts and heatmaps

## Business Applications

This implementation demonstrates how organizations can:

1. **Compare departmental compensation** strategies
2. **Analyze salary distribution** across age groups
3. **Identify compensation trends** for workforce planning
4. **Support HR decisions** for salary benchmarking
5. **Enable multidimensional analysis** for strategic planning

## Future Enhancements

1. **Add more dimensions**: Location, experience level, education
2. **Implement drill-down operations**: Department → Team → Individual
3. **Add time dimension**: Historical salary trends
4. **Implement roll-up operations**: Aggregate to higher levels
5. **Add more complex measures**: Bonus, benefits, total compensation

This project serves as a comprehensive example of data warehouse OLAP implementations, showcasing different approaches to multidimensional data analysis in a business context.
